My name is Jace Innis. I am a recent graduate of marine science and interested in the ocean's role in global development. Including everything from phisical ocean conditions, to phytoplankton ecology to overfishing and habitat restoration.
Currently (or when this was written, July 2022) I am teaching English in the small town of Mapastepec Mexico. I am an avid traveler, reader, diver, and hiker. I enjoy solving problems and learning new skills.

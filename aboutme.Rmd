My name is Jace Innis. I am a recent graduate of marine science and interested in how physical ocean conditions affect phytoplankton, and therefore the world. What interests me the most is the equation of carbon, harmful algal blooms, and measuring things like secondary production and allelopathy.  
Currently (or when this was written, July 2022) I am teaching English in the small town of Mapastepec Mexico. I am an avid traveler, reader, diver, and hiker. I enjoy solving problems and learning new skills.

I made the animation above to help visualize shark tracking data [Tagging of Pacific Predators](http://www.coml.org/projects/tagging-pacific-predators-topp.html)


Data visualization, particularly animating movement, plays a crucial role in tracking data by providing a concise and engaging way to understand and communicate complex patterns and behaviors. Sharks are highly mobile creatures, and their movements can be influenced by various factors such as migration, feeding, and breeding. By animating the movement of sharks using visual representations, such as maps or charts, scientists and researchers can effectively convey information about their habitats, migration routes, and potential interactions with other species. 


This dynamic visualization enhances our understanding of shark behavior. It shows very clearly what is called by scientist '**the shark cafe**'. The region between Hawaii and Baja California that has a lot of shark activity.

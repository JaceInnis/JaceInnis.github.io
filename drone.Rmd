As a student of CSUMBâ€™s done specialist, we programmed and deployed a drone to collect RGB data in the Elkhorn Slough habitat restoration area. This was in order to assess the changes of *salicornia pacifica* over a period of five years. The figure above shows the original image, the classified raster made through a supervised learning algorithm, and the zones used to control for geospatial differences in an ANOVA test.

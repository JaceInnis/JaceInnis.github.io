Over the course of a year, I used various methods in order to see what environmental variables are important in the prediction of shellfish toxicity in the Philippines. I digitized over a decade of  [HAB reports](http://bfar-frmdhabmonitoring.com.ph/shellfishBulletins/102) from BFAR, a [government agency in the philippines](https://www.bfar.da.gov.ph/). Using this data, which reports the presence of toxic sites, I utilized Java to access data from Google Earth Engine [(GEE)](https://earthengine.google.com/), a geospatial data management system.

### Independent research project

For my independent research, I used a novel AI algorithm to predict site toxicity. I trained and tested an artificial neural network using [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) and [Keras](https://keras.io/), two packages made for deep learning. I am continuing my research with support from the Tandy Center for Ocean Forecasting at Bigelow Marine Labs but my initial results are promising. 


### Logistic regression parameter verification
<center>

 $$\LARGE \pi = \frac{e^{\beta _{year}+\beta _{month}+\beta_{sal}+\beta_{vel}+\beta_{temp}+\beta_{temp+vel}}}{1+e^{\beta _{year}+\beta _{month}+\beta_{sal}+\beta_{vel}+\beta_{temp}+\beta_{temp+vel}}}$$ 

###### $\pi$ = the probability of there being a toxic site, $\beta_x$ = envormental variables/time of observation

In order to verify my results from the neural network, I conducted a more transparent statistical analysis. A logistic regression was the most appropriate model to test probability. Every environmental variableâ€™s ability to predict site toxicity was tested, accounting for time of the year. The equation above was the final model and used water velocity, salinity, and temperature .
